**New minor version version::``0.3.0-beta`` of Â¨lymath:** see all the changes below.


**New macro ``\lymathsubsep``:** this defines the separators of arguments for a second level. By default it is a semi-colon but if this will be a coma if the option ``french`` of ``babel`` is activated.


**Logic and fundations:** here are the new features in this new section.

    1) Different kind of equal signs are available.

    2) The macro ``\explain`` allows to explain efficiently formal reasonning or calculus.


**Sets:** here are the new features.

    1) ``\fieldset`` has been renamed ``\algeset``.

    2) One new classical set added : ``\PP`` indicates the set of prime numbers.


**Geometry:** here are the new features.

    1) The macro ``\hangleorient`` writes oriented angles of vectors using a hat.

    2) The macros ``\vangleorient`` and ``\vhangleorient`` are shortcuts to not use ``\vect`` when writing oriented angles of vectors without or with a hat.

    3) The macros ``\vdotprod``, ``\vadotprod`` and ``\vcroosprod`` are shortcuts to not use ``\vect`` when writing dot and cross products.
