**New minor version version::``0.2.0-beta`` of Â¨lymath:** see all the changes below.


**One regression repaired :** when the option ``french`` of ``babel`` was activated, auto spacing around semi-colon was broken.


**One major change in the interface:** for macros using unbounded numbers of arguments, the use ``//``+`` has been replaced by the use of ``|``.


**New macro ``\lymathsep``:** this defines the separators of arguments. By default it is a coma but if this will be a semi-colon if the option ``french`` of ``babel`` is activated.


**Automatic spacings:** extra spaces are automatically added when using ``\frac`` and ``\dfrac``.


**Analysis:** one new macro ``\derpow*`` adds automatically the good number of prime for the derivative of one function.


**Geometry:** here are the new features.

    1) Two new macros ``\coord`` and ``\vcoord`` allows to write coordinates of points and vectors.

    2) The macro ``\angleorient`` allows to write oriented angles of vectors.

    3) The macros ``\dotprod`` and ``\adotprod`` are for scalar products.

    4) The macro ``\crossprod`` is for cross products of 3D vectors.

    5) The use of ``axis`` has been by the better translation ``axes``.

    6) ``\gpaxis`` and ``\gpvaxis`` have been renamed ``\paxes`` and ``\pvaxes`` because ``\gpt`` will be no longer used.


**Algebra:** you can write sets of polynomials, or of formal series with their fractional fields, and alos the polynomials and formal series of Laurent.


**Internal changes in the factory:** a deep cleaning has been acheived.
