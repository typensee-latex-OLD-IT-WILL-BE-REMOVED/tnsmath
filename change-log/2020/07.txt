**Analysis :** the indice version of the partial derivation uses comas to separate the different variables (for example, this avoids confusion between `xy` and `x y`).

**New minor version version::``1.2.0-beta`` of Â¨lymath:** see all the changes below.


**Analysis :** the tables of signs can be now decorated with a short text or a very small graph to explain the signs of an affine function or a parabolic one (this works also with the tables of variations).


**Machinery in backstage : ** improvment of the way to manage the imports of packages with their options and special dependancies like the use of ``\usetikzlibrary`` (a new small tool should born from this improvment in the future).
