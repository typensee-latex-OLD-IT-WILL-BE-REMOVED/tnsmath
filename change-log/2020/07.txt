**New minor version version::``1.3.0-beta`` of ¨lymath:** the package has been renamed ¨tnsmath with a change of ¨github repositery
((
    ``tns`` is for "type and see".
)).
This new version will just import packages developped separitely in the future. This choice allows users to just use one feature of the preceding package ¨lymath without having all the machinery. Here is the list of the very new "small" packages that have just born.


    1) ``tnscom`` contains common tools and settings used by all the `tns...` packages. It contains the following old parts of ¨lymath.

        * path::``01-misc/00-common-tools.sty`` (all the meta programming and the separartors)
        * path::``01-misc/01-spaces-semi-colon.sty``
        * path::``01-misc/02-spaces.sty`` (except the extra space for the not symbol)


    1) ``tnsana`` tries to simplify the writting of basic analysis. It contains the following old parts of ¨lymath.

        * path::``05-analysis/01-constants.sty``
        * path::``05-analysis/02-abs-function.sty``

        * path::``05-analysis/06-integral-calculus.sty``


    1) ``tnsarith`` helps in writing basic arithmetic. It contains the following old parts of ¨lymath.

        * path::``07-arithmetic/01-basic-operators.sty``
        * path::``07-arithmetic/02-continued-fraction.sty``


    1) ``tnsgeo`` contains macros to write efficiently standard geometry. It contains the following old parts of ¨lymath.

        * path::``04-geometry/01-point-n-line.sty``
        * path::``04-geometry/02-1-vector.sty``

        * path::``04-geometry/02-3-vector-products.sty``
        * path::``04-geometry/02-4-vector-2D-colinearity.sty``
        * path::``04-geometry/03-1-cartesian-coordinates.sty``

        * path::``08-algebra/02-matrices.sty``


    1) ``tnslog`` simplifies the ways to write more or less formal reasonings. It contains the following old parts of ¨lymath.

        * path::``01-misc/02-spaces.sty`` (only the extra space for the not symbol)
        * path::``02-logic/01-equal-signs-n-co.sty``
        * path::``02-logic/02-operators.sty``
        * path::``02-logic/04-quantifiers.sty``
        * path::``02-logic/05-calc-explained.sty``

        * path::``05-analysis/08-big-small-O-and-co.sty``


    1) ``tnssets`` is for general theory of sets and applications. It contains the following old parts of ¨lymath.

        * path::``03-sets-n-applications/01-general-sets.sty``
        * path::``03-sets-n-applications/02-intervals.sty``
        * path::``03-sets-n-applications/03-operators.sty``

**Analysis :** the indice version of the partial derivation adds comas to separate the different variables (this avoids confusion between `xy` and `x y` for example).


**Documentation :** the technical informations of the macros ``\comLine`` and ``\graphSign`` for decorating tables of signs were missing.

**New minor version version::``1.2.0-beta`` of ¨lymath:** see all the changes below.


**Analysis :** the tables of signs can be now decorated with a short text or a very small graph to explain the signs of an affine function or a parabolic one (this works also with the tables of variations).


**Machinery in backstage : ** improvment of the way to manage the imports of packages with their options and special dependancies like the use of ``\usetikzlibrary`` (a new small tool should born from this improvment in the future).
