**New minor version version::``1.2.0-beta`` of Â¨lymath:** see all the changes below.


**Analysis :** the tables of signs can be now decorated with a short text or a very small graph to explain the signs of an affine function or a parabolic one (this works also with the table of variations).


**Backstage machinery : ** the way to manage the import of packages with their options and special dependancies like the use of ``\usetikzlibrary`` has been improved (a new small tool should born from this improvment).
