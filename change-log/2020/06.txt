**New major version version::``1.0.0-beta`` of ¨lymath:** the change to a new major version is motivated by the new stricter rules for the ¨API.
As a consequence there are a lot of backward incompatibilities. See all the changes below.


**Analysis :** there are brand new things.

    1) The pedagogical macro ``\ct`` has been renamed ``\param``.

    1) The way to write integrals has evolved.

        * The new macros ``\integrate`` and ``\dintegrate`` can be used to write simple integrals (there is no multivariable calculus support for the moment).

        * The signature of ``\hook`` has changed from ``\hook{F(x)}{a}{b}`` to ``\hook{a}{b}{F(x)}{x}`` and it has now options.

        * The macros ``\vhook`` and ``\vhook*`` have been removed. To obtain the same features you will have to use ``\hook[r]`` and ``\hook[sr]``.

    1) Here what is new for the total derivation.

        * ``\dd`` should uses a better spacing.

        * There are only three macros ``\sder``, ``\der`` and ``\derope``.

        * ``\sder`` and ``\sder[e]`` replace ``\derpow*`` and ``\derpow`` (there are two options to add parenthesis).


        * ``\der`` must be used with also the variable of derivation. This macro has several options for different kinds of formattings (the output made by ``\derfrac``, ``\derfrac*`` and ``\dersub`` before are still possible).

        * ``\derope`` allows to write a functional operator.


    1) Here what is new for the partial derivation.

        * ``\pp`` should uses a better spacing.

        * There are only two macros ``\pder`` and ``\pderope``.

        * ``\pder`` has options to replace the use of ``\partialfrac`` and ``\partialsub``.

        * The formatting made before by ``\partialprime`` has been removed.

        * ``\pderope`` allows to write a functional operator.


**Arithmetic :** the macro ``\nequiv`` has been addded.


**Geometry :** some signatures have changed.

    1) For dot products just the macro ``\dotprod`` stays with several options.

        * ``\adotprod``  become ``\dotprod[a]``.

        * ``\adotprod*`` become ``\dotprod[sa]``.


    1) For oriented angles just the macro ``\angleorient`` stays with several options.

        * ``\angleorient*`` become ``\angleorient[sp]``.

        * ``\hangleorient`` become ``\angleorient[h]``.

        * ``\hangleorient*`` become ``\angleorient[sh]``.


**Probability :** the macros ``\probacond**`` and ``\dprobacond**`` become ``\probacondexp*`` and ``\probacondexp`` respectively.

==========

**Algebra :** here are the changes.

    1) ``\cdettwo`` has been renamed ``\calcdettwo``.

    1) ``\calcdettwo`` has an optional argument to choose the formatting wanted (in backstage the formattings are exactly the same as the ones done by the macro ``\calcdetplane`` without vectors).


**Arithmetic :** ``\notdivides`` has been renamed ``\ndivides``.


**Geometry :** here are the changes.

    1) Some renamings have been done.

        * ``\cdetplane``     and ``\vcdetplane``
          become
          ``\calcdetplane``  and ``\vcalcdetplane``.

        * ``\ccrossprod``    and ``\vccrossprod``
          become
          ``\calccrossprod`` and ``\vcalccrossprod``.

    1) Here are the brand new features for the determinant of two vectors of the plane.

        * With the optional argument it is now possible to ask to  ``\calcdetplane`` or ``\vcalcdetplane`` to print an expanded calculation in a form like `x y' - y x'`.

        * When they are printed the vectors are now smaller suchas to not polluate the reading of the determinant.

    1) A new macro ``\coordcrossprod`` prints the expanded coordinates in a form like `(y z' - z y' , z x' - x z ' , x y' - y x')`. An optional argument can be used to choose the formatting of the coordinates and of the products.

    1) The way to print coordinates has totally changed.

        * The starred macro ``\coord*`` has been removed.

        * There are three macros : ``\coord`` for coordinates alone, ``\pcoord`` for a point with its coordinates and ``\vcoord`` for a vector with its coordinates.

        * The macros ``\pcoord*`` and ``\vcoord*`` give back to the writer the responsabilty of formatting the point or the vector instead of automatically used ``\pt`` or ``\vect``.

        * All of this macros have an optional argument to choose the formatting : parenthesis in horizontal mode, brackets in vertical mode...

    1) The way to write norms has changed.

        * The starred macro ``\norm*`` has been removed.

        * The none extensible version is obtained now via ``\norm[s]{...}``.

        * A new macro ``\vnorm`` has been added sucha as to write the just the name of a vector (it has the same options as ``\norm``).


**Logic :** here are the changes.

    1) Some renamings have been done (the "not" version of a macro will allways have a name using the prefix `n` alone).

        * ``\notiff``     and ``\notviff``
          become
          ``\niff``       and ``\nviff``.

        * ``\notimplies`` and ``\notvimplies``
          become
          ``\nimplies``   and ``\nvimplies``.

        * ``\notliesimp`` and ``\notvliesimp``
          become
          ``\nliesimp``   and ``\nvliesimp``.

    1) All the comparing operators have a negative version.

    1) Some macros have been added for the text used by the table explaining "real" reasonings :

        * ``\textexplainmiddleID``

        * ``\textexplainmiddlecons``.

        * ``\textexplainuniversityhyps``

        * ``\textexplainuniversityhyp``

        * ``\textexplainuniversityccl``

    1) For the explanations of "real" reasonings, the features of the macros
    ``\explref`` and ``\explref*`` have been switched (this is necuse in ¨lymath the starred macros use to do less work).


**Documentation:** tables for suffixes and/or prefixes have been simplified.

**Geometry :** the formatting of the calculations explained of the determinant of two 2D-vectors and the cross product of two 3D-vectors was bad when using `x_B - x_A` and co. This has been fixed and the looking is better now.


==========
2020-06-14
==========

**Logic and fundations:** here are the new features.

    1) The standard operator ``\neg`` works now with a thin space after it. The standard behaviour is obtained by using ``\stdneg``.

    1) The environments ``explain``, ``aexplain`` and ``aexplain*`` use now a blue color for the explanations and the macro ``\explsymb`` has been removed (a boolean is used in backstage).

    1) The environment ``explain`` works a little differently internally.

        a) The macro constants ``\textexplainleft`` and ``\textexplainright``  have been removed and the macro constant ``\textexplainspacein`` has been renamed ``\expltxtspacein``.

        a) The macros ``\explnext`` uses now one customizable macro ``\expltxt``.

        a) The macros ``\explnext*`` uses now two customizable macros ``\expltxtdown`` and ``\expltxtup``.

    1) The environments ``demoexplain`` and ``demoexplain*`` allow to write demonstrations using an efficient and rigorous tabular like formatting.

**Algebra :** one pedagogical useful new feature shows how to calculate the determinant of square matrices of dimension `2`. See the macro ``\cdettwo``.


**Geometry :** an almost "perfect" formatting of the calculations explained of the determinant of two 2D-vectors and the cross product of two 3D-vectors.


**Logic and fundations:** here are the new features.

    1) Two environments ``aexplain`` and ``aexplain*`` allows to use arrows to indicate explanations (examples have also been added to show how to use ``explain``, ``aexplain`` or ``aexplain*`` suchas to to do step by step manipulations with alignment regarding one or several symbols).

    1) Unwanted spaces are no longer added before and after the environement ``explain``.


**Probability :** some enhancements have been made.

    1) ``\expval`` is a new macro for the symbolic writing of the expected value of a random variable.

    1) Better spaces before automatically added braces has been achieved when writing symbolically probabilties.

**Geometry :** better formatting, but not still perfect, of calculations explained of the determinant of two 2D-vectors and of the cross product of two 3D-vectors.


**Logic and fundations:** the macro ``\explain`` has been deleted. Now you must use the environment ``explain`` associated to the macro ``\explnext``. This simplifies a lot the writting !

**Geometry :* two pedagogical useful new features for vectors.

    1) Calculation explained of the determinant of two vectors in a plane : see ``\cdetplane``, ``\cdetplane*``, ``\vcdetplane`` and ``\vcdetplane*``.

    1) Calculation explained of the cross product of two vectors of the 3D space : see ``\ccrossprod`` and ``\vccrossprod``.

**New minor version version::``0.7.0-beta`` of ¨lymath:** see all the changes below. There are some backward incompatibilities.


**Analysis :** here are the new features.

    1) ``\ch``, ``\sh``, ``\th``, ``\ach``, ``\ash`` and ``\ath`` have been renamed ``\fch``, ``\fsh``, ``\fth``, ``\afch``, ``\afsh`` and ``\afth`` because ``\ch`` is used by some more serious package than ¨lymath.

    1) ``\acosh``, ``\asinh`` and ``\atanh`` have been added.

    1) ``\derpar`` and ``\derpar*`` write extensible braces before the derivation the power indicated the degree of derivation. For non extensible braces, there are ``\sderpar`` and ``\sderpar*``.

    1) ``\stdint`` is the standard integral operator.


**Geometry : ** one deletion and three new things.

    1) ``\pts`` has been supressed because of its lake of semantic meaning.

    1) `\gline`` and ``\pgline`` are for lines whereas ``\hgline``is for half lines and ``\segment`` is for segments.


**Logic :** here are the enhancements.

    1) Inequalities can be decorated with "plot".

    1) Negative versions of the vertical logic operators have been added.


**Probability :** some modifications have been made.

    1) ``\proba`` is a new macro for the writing of "basic" probabilities.

    1) ``\probacond`` has a new signature which is more logical.


**One internal update regarding to ``amsmath``:** the macro ``\DeclareMathMacro`` has been changed to ``\DeclareMathOperator``.


**Simplification of the documentation:** the ¨latex codes just show now the use of the macros outside any context such as to see directly what is proposed by the package. Another thing : the technical informations have been moved to a dedicated section.


**A better way to manage internally the changes for the log :** see the folder path::``factory/99-major-change-log``.
