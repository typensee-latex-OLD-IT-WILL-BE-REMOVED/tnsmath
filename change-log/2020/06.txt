**Logic and fundations:** here are the new features.

    1) The standard operator ``\neg`` works now with a thin space after it. The standard behaviour is obtained by using ``\stdneg``.

    1) The environments ``explain``, ``aexplain`` and ``aexplain*`` use now a blue color for the explanations and the macro ``\explsymb`` has been removed (a boolean is used in backstage).

    1) The environment ``explain`` works a little differently internally.

        a) The macro constants ``\textexplainleft`` and ``\textexplainright``  have been removed and the macro constant ``\textexplainspacein`` has been renamed ``\expltxtspacein``.

        a) The macros ``\explnext`` uses now one customizable macro ``\expltxt``.

        a) The macros ``\explnext*`` uses now two customizable macros ``\expltxtdown`` and ``\expltxtup``.

    1) The environments ``demoexplain`` and ``demoexplain*`` allow to write demonstrations using an efficent and rigorous tabular like formatting.

**Algebra :** one pedagogical useful new feature shows how to calculate the determinant of square matrices of dimension `2`.


**Geometry :** an almost "perfect" formatting of the calculations explained of the determinant of two 2D-vectors and the cross product of two 3D-vectors.


**Logic and fundations:** here are the new features.

    1) Two environments ``aexplain`` and ``aexplain*`` allows to use arrows to indicate explanations (examples have also been added to show how to use ``explain``, ``aexplain`` or ``aexplain*`` suchas to to do step by step manipulations with alignment regarding one or several symbols).

    1) Unwanted spaces are no longer added before and after the environement ``explain``.


**Probability :** some enhancements have been made.

    1) ``\expval`` is a new macro for the symbolic writing of the expected value of a random variable.

    1) Better spaces before automatically added braces has been achieved when writing symbolically probabilties.

**Geometry :** better formatting, but not still perfect, of calculations explained of the determinant of two 2D-vectors and of the cross product of two 3D-vectors.


**Logic and fundations:** the macro ``\explain`` has been deleted. Now you must use the environment ``explain`` associated to the macro ``\explnext``. This simplifies a lot the writting !

**Geometry :* two pedagogical useful new features for vectors.

    1) Calculation explained of the determinant of two vectors in a plane : see ``\cdetplane``, ``\cdetplane*``, ``\vcdetplane`` and ``\vcdetplane*``.

    1) Calculation explained of the cross product of two vectors of the 3D space : see ``\ccrossprod`` and ``\vccrossprod``.

**New minor version version::``0.7.0-beta`` of ¨lymath:** see all the changes below. There are some backward incompatibilities.


**Analysis :** here are the new features.

    1) ``\ch``, ``\sh``, ``\th``, ``\ach``, ``\ash`` and ``\ath`` have been renamed ``\fch``, ``\fsh``, ``\fth``, ``\afch``, ``\afsh`` and ``\afth`` because ``\ch`` is used by some more serious package than ¨lymath.

    1) ``\acosh``, ``\asinh`` and ``\atanh`` have been added.

    1) ``\derpar`` and ``\derpar*`` write extensible braces before the derivation the power indicated the degree of derivation. For non extensible braces, there are ``\sderpar`` and ``\sderpar*``.

    1) ``\stdint`` is the standard integral operator.


**Geometry : ** one deletion and three new things.

    1) ``\pts`` has been supressed because of its lake of semantic meaning.

    1) `\gline`` and ``\pgline`` are for lines whereas ``\hgline``is for half lines and ``\segment`` is for segments.


**Logic :** here are the enhancements.

    1) Inequalities can be decorated with "plot".

    1) Negative versions of the vertical logic operators have been added.


**Probability :** some modifications have been made.

    1) ``\proba`` is a new macro for the writing of "basic" probabilities.

    1) ``\probacond`` has a new signature which is more logical.


**One internal update regarding to ``amsmath``:** the macro ``\DeclareMathMacro`` has been changed to ``\DeclareMathOperator``.


**Simplification of the documentation:** the ¨latex codes just show now the use of the macros outside any context such as to see directly what is proposed by the package. Another thing : the technical informations have been moved to a dedicated section.


**A better way to manage internally the changes for the log :** see the folder path::``factory/99-major-change-log``.
