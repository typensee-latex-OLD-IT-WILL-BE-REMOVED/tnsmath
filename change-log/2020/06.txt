**Logic :** some tunings have been done for the calculus and the proofs explained.

    1) All the macros for texts have been renamed.

    1) One macro indicating that one long table continues on the next page has been added.

    1) The preceding text is also added in the case of use of the university mode.

    1) Two pictures show in the documentation long tables broken on two pages.


**Special spacings :** the special macro ``\sqrt`` will use from now ``\leftroot{4}\uproot{2}`` instead of ``\leftroot{3}`` to obtain a better output.

**New minor version version::``1.1.0-beta`` of ¨lymath :** this change of minor version comes from the new API of the environments for explaining calculus or simple reasonnings.


**Logic :** new changes especially for the explanation of a calculus or a simple reasonning.

    1) The environments ``aexplain`` and ``aexplain*`` have been removed. Their formattings are still available by using the environment ``explain`` with the options ``style = ar`` and ``style = sar`` respectively.

    1) The environment ``explain`` has now several key-value options.

    1) Two new macros ``comthis`` and ``comthis*`` can be used to add very little comment.

    1) The university version of ``\explnext*`` has been modified.

        * When bottom-up explications are given, the contents are centered and big braces are used for the both contents (the "hard" job is done by ``\exptxtupdown``).
        The mechanism used doesn't change the way to customize the macros ``\expltxtdown`` and ``\expltxtup``.

        * The braces are straight and not italic now (this looks prettier).

    1) The environments ``demoexplain`` and ``demoexplain*`` use ``longtable`` in backstage such as to allow a table to be printed on several pages.

**Logic :** some little important enhancements have been done to explain calculus or reasonnings.

    1) The environments ``explain``, ``aexplain`` and  ``aexplain*`` have the same automatic vertical spacings. This has been acheived simply by just using the environment ``WithArrows`` for ``explain``.

    1) The new version of ``witharrows`` is used to obtain simply the double arrows feature.

    1) With the environments ``demoexplain`` and ``demoexplain*`` the hypothesis and the conclusion are now underlined with the same minimal vertical gap (this is simply obtained by using ``\vphantom``).

**New major version version::``1.0.0-beta`` of ¨lymath :** the change to a new major version is motivated by the new stricter rules for the ¨API.
As a consequence there are a lot of backward incompatibilities. See all the changes below.


**Analysis :** there are brand new things.

    1) The pedagogical macro ``\ct`` has been renamed ``\param``.

    1) The way to write integrals has evolved.

        * The new macros ``\integrate`` and ``\dintegrate`` can be used to write simple integrals (there is no multivariable calculus support for the moment).

        * The signature of ``\hook`` has changed from ``\hook{F(x)}{a}{b}`` to ``\hook{a}{b}{F(x)}{x}`` and it has now options.

        * The macros ``\vhook`` and ``\vhook*`` have been removed. To obtain the same features you will have to use ``\hook[r]`` and ``\hook[sr]``.

    1) Here what is new for the total derivation.

        * ``\dd`` should uses a better spacing.

        * There are only three macros ``\sder``, ``\der`` and ``\derope``.

        * ``\sder`` and ``\sder[e]`` replace ``\derpow*`` and ``\derpow`` (there are two options to add parenthesis).

        * ``\der`` must be used with also the variable of derivation. This macro has several options for different kinds of formattings (the output made by ``\derfrac``, ``\derfrac*`` and ``\dersub`` before are still possible).

        * ``\derope`` allows to write a functional operator.


    1) Here what is new for the partial derivation.

        * ``\pp`` should uses a better spacing.

        * There are only two macros ``\pder`` and ``\pderope``.

        * ``\pder`` has options to replace the use of ``\partialfrac`` and ``\partialsub``.

        * The formatting made before by ``\partialprime`` has been removed.

        * ``\pderope`` allows to write a functional operator.


**Arithmetic :** the macro ``\nequiv`` has been addded.


**Geometry :** some signatures have changed.

    1) For dot products just the macro ``\dotprod`` stays with several options.

        * ``\adotprod``  become ``\dotprod[a]``.

        * ``\adotprod*`` become ``\dotprod[sa]``.


    1) For oriented angles just the macro ``\angleorient`` stays with several options.

        * ``\angleorient*`` become ``\angleorient[sp]``.

        * ``\hangleorient`` become ``\angleorient[h]``.

        * ``\hangleorient*`` become ``\angleorient[sh]``.


**Probability :** the macros ``\probacond**`` and ``\dprobacond**`` become ``\probacondexp*`` and ``\probacondexp`` respectively.


==========
2020-06-19
==========

**Algebra :** here are the changes.

    1) ``\cdettwo`` has been renamed ``\calcdettwo``.

    1) ``\calcdettwo`` has an optional argument to choose the formatting wanted (in backstage the formattings are exactly the same as the ones done by the macro ``\calcdetplane`` without vectors).


**Arithmetic :** ``\notdivides`` has been renamed ``\ndivides``.


**Geometry :** here are the changes.

    1) Some renamings have been done.

        * ``\cdetplane``     and ``\vcdetplane``
          become
          ``\calcdetplane``  and ``\vcalcdetplane``.

        * ``\ccrossprod``    and ``\vccrossprod``
          become
          ``\calccrossprod`` and ``\vcalccrossprod``.

    1) Here are the brand new features for the determinant of two vectors of the plane.

        * With the optional argument it is now possible to ask to  ``\calcdetplane`` or ``\vcalcdetplane`` to print an expanded calculation in a form like `x y' - y x'`.

        * When they are printed the vectors are now smaller suchas to not polluate the reading of the determinant.

    1) A new macro ``\coordcrossprod`` prints the expanded coordinates in a form like `(y z' - z y' , z x' - x z ' , x y' - y x')`. An optional argument can be used to choose the formatting of the coordinates and of the products.

    1) The way to print coordinates has totally changed.

        * The starred macro ``\coord*`` has been removed.

        * There are three macros : ``\coord`` for coordinates alone, ``\pcoord`` for a point with its coordinates and ``\vcoord`` for a vector with its coordinates.

        * The macros ``\pcoord*`` and ``\vcoord*`` give back to the writer the responsabilty of formatting the point or the vector instead of automatically used ``\pt`` or ``\vect``.

        * All of this macros have an optional argument to choose the formatting : parenthesis in horizontal mode, brackets in vertical mode...

    1) The way to write norms has changed.

        * The starred macro ``\norm*`` has been removed.

        * The none extensible version is obtained now via ``\norm[s]{...}``.

        * A new macro ``\vnorm`` has been added sucha as to write the just the name of a vector (it has the same options as ``\norm``).


**Logic :** here are the changes.

    1) Some renamings have been done (the "not" version of a macro will allways have a name using the prefix `n` alone).

        * ``\notiff``     and ``\notviff``
          become
          ``\niff``       and ``\nviff``.

        * ``\notimplies`` and ``\notvimplies``
          become
          ``\nimplies``   and ``\nvimplies``.

        * ``\notliesimp`` and ``\notvliesimp``
          become
          ``\nliesimp``   and ``\nvliesimp``.

    1) All the comparing operators have a negative version.

    1) Some macros have been added for the text used by the table explaining "real" reasonings :

        * ``\textexplainmiddleID``

        * ``\textexplainmiddlecons``.

        * ``\textexplainuniversityhyps``

        * ``\textexplainuniversityhyp``

        * ``\textexplainuniversityccl``

    1) For the explanations of "real" reasonings, the features of the macros
    ``\explref`` and ``\explref*`` have been switched (this is necuse in ¨lymath the starred macros use to do less work).


**Documentation :** tables for suffixes and/or prefixes have been simplified.


==========
2020-06-15
==========

**Geometry :** the formatting of the calculations explained of the determinant of two 2D-vectors and the cross product of two 3D-vectors was bad when using `x_B - x_A` and co. This has been fixed and the looking is better now.


==========
2020-06-14
==========

**Logic and fundations :** here are the new features.

    1) The standard operator ``\neg`` works now with a thin space after it. The standard behaviour is obtained by using ``\stdneg``.

    1) The environments ``explain``, ``aexplain`` and ``aexplain*`` use now a blue color for the explanations and the macro ``\explsymb`` has been removed (a boolean is used in backstage).

    1) The environment ``explain`` works a little differently internally.

        a) The macro constants ``\textexplainleft`` and ``\textexplainright``  have been removed and the macro constant ``\textexplainspacein`` has been renamed ``\expltxtspacein``.

        a) The macros ``\explnext`` uses now one customizable macro ``\expltxt``.

        a) The macros ``\explnext*`` uses now two customizable macros ``\expltxtdown`` and ``\expltxtup``.

    1) The environments ``demoexplain`` and ``demoexplain*`` allow to write demonstrations using an efficient and rigorous tabular like formatting.

**Algebra :** one pedagogical useful new feature shows how to calculate the determinant of square matrices of dimension `2`. See the macro ``\cdettwo``.


**Geometry :** an almost "perfect" formatting of the calculations explained of the determinant of two 2D-vectors and the cross product of two 3D-vectors.


**Logic and fundations :** here are the new features.

    1) Two environments ``aexplain`` and ``aexplain*`` allows to use arrows to indicate explanations (examples have also been added to show how to use ``explain``, ``aexplain`` or ``aexplain*`` suchas to to do step by step manipulations with alignment regarding one or several symbols).

    1) Unwanted spaces are no longer added before and after the environement ``explain``.


**Probability :** some enhancements have been made.

    1) ``\expval`` is a new macro for the symbolic writing of the expected value of a random variable.

    1) Better spaces before automatically added braces has been achieved when writing symbolically probabilties.


==========
2020-06-11
==========

**Geometry :** better formatting, but not still perfect, of calculations explained of the determinant of two 2D-vectors and of the cross product of two 3D-vectors.


**Logic and fundations :** the macro ``\explain`` has been deleted. Now you must use the environment ``explain`` associated to the macro ``\explnext``. This simplifies a lot the writting !


==========
2020-06-09
==========

**Geometry :* two pedagogical useful new features for vectors.

    1) Calculation explained of the determinant of two vectors in a plane : see ``\cdetplane``, ``\cdetplane*``, ``\vcdetplane`` and ``\vcdetplane*``.

    1) Calculation explained of the cross product of two vectors of the 3D space : see ``\ccrossprod`` and ``\vccrossprod``.

**New minor version version::``0.7.0-beta`` of ¨lymath :** see all the changes below. There are some backward incompatibilities.


**Analysis :** here are the new features.

    1) ``\ch``, ``\sh``, ``\th``, ``\ach``, ``\ash`` and ``\ath`` have been renamed ``\fch``, ``\fsh``, ``\fth``, ``\afch``, ``\afsh`` and ``\afth`` because ``\ch`` is used by some more serious package than ¨lymath.

    1) ``\acosh``, ``\asinh`` and ``\atanh`` have been added.

    1) ``\derpar`` and ``\derpar*`` write extensible braces before the derivation the power indicated the degree of derivation. For non extensible braces, there are ``\sderpar`` and ``\sderpar*``.

    1) ``\stdint`` is the standard integral operator.


**Geometry : ** one deletion and three new things.

    1) ``\pts`` has been supressed because of its lake of semantic meaning.

    1) `\gline`` and ``\pgline`` are for lines whereas ``\hgline``is for half lines and ``\segment`` is for segments.


**Logic :** here are the enhancements.

    1) Inequalities can be decorated with "plot".

    1) Negative versions of the vertical logic operators have been added.


**Probability :** some modifications have been made.

    1) ``\proba`` is a new macro for the writing of "basic" probabilities.

    1) ``\probacond`` has a new signature which is more logical.


**One internal update regarding to ``amsmath`` :** the macro ``\DeclareMathMacro`` has been changed to ``\DeclareMathOperator``.


**Simplification of the documentation :** the ¨latex codes just show now the use of the macros outside any context such as to see directly what is proposed by the package. Another thing : the technical informations have been moved to a dedicated section.


**A better way to manage internally the changes for the log :** see the folder path::``factory/99-major-change-log``.
