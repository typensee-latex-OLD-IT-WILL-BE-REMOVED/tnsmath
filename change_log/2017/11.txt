**New minor version version::``0.1.0-beta`` of Â¨lymath:** see all the changes below.


**Sets**: several changes have been done.

    1) The macros ``\geoset``, ``\probaset`` and ``\fieldset`` have now star versions that allow the use of subscript.

    2) One new macro ``\geneset`` helps the writing of general sets inside braces.


**Functions:** one new macro ``\abs`` and its star verion allow to write absolute values.


**Geometry:** several changes have been done.

    1) ``\pt`` becomes ``\gpt`` such as to avoid a conflict with \verb+lyxam+ another project of the author of \verb+lymath+.

    2) The macros ``\gpt`` has now a star version such as to allow subscripting.

    3) The macros ``\vect`` and ``\vect*`` will not print the point above "i" and "j" when this letters are the "main" name of the vector.

    A similar feature has been added for the macros ``\anglein``, ``\arc`` and their star versions.

    4) One new macro ``\norm`` and its star verion allow to write norms of vectors.

    5) One new macro ``\axis`` and its star verion helps in writing names of axes in a cartesian system of coordinates.

    There are also ``\gpaxis``, ``\vaxis`` and ``\gpvaxis`` which in day to day writing can be helpful.


**Internal major changes:** here are the changes.

    1) We use everywhere suffixes ``@star`` and ``@no@star`` for definitions of star and no star versions of a macro.

    2) Standardization of the use of star versions: when this means something, for each macro, its potential star version will allways be the one using less spaces. This implies the switch of behavior for all the following macros :

        * `\inteval..` and its star version `\inteval..*`.
        * `\Zinteval..` and `\Zinteval..*`
        * `\hook` and `\hook*`
        * `\vhook` and `\vhook*`
