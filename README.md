What about this package  ?
==========================

**ly-math**, which is a contraction of **lyc√©e** and **math**, has been built to allow the writings of more semantical LaTeX documents at a very low level of mathematics.



What about this first version `0.0.0-beta` ?
============================================

All informations are inside the PDF named `lymath-doc.pdf` inside the folder `lymath`.

The only thing needed to use the package is the folder `lymath`.


I beg your pardon for my english...
===================================

English is not my native language, so be nice if you notice misunderstandings, misspellings or grammatical errors in my documents and my codes.
